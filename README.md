 # GWU Sweden Bylaws

 The bylaws are defined in text files following a format known as Markdown (`.md` files), more specifically the [extended syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#overview) for the use of footnotes.

If there is something you think should be changed, maybe create an issue to start a discussion. Or feel free to open a pull request if its a smaller change or you feel thats a better way to go overall. :fox_face:
